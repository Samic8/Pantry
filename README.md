# Pantry üçÜ
Pantry estimates when you need to restock your kitchen cupboard, it learns more about your usage the more you use it. Pantry is in a prototype state of development so don't expect much in the way of unit tests or documentation yet.

## Design
There early design prototypes [on a Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/PB3uVQbeSEQ14qQO4hrPionR/Pantry?node-id=103%3A0&viewport=407%2C321%2C0.249057&scaling=min-zoom).

npm run make:client:dev
```
This needs to be ran on changes to .elm files
