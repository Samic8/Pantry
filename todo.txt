# Road-map Ideas
- Use affiliation marketing to generate collection of low items and add them to a shopping cart online
- Use web hooks to allow real time collaboration (e.g one user updates the other uses see the updates)
- Show estimated days in 'weeks' when goes past 7 days
- Undo restocks that happened today
- Use typescript on the node backend
- Write unit tests for backend
- Improve estimates e.g could be calculated in shorted period other then days (e.g hours)
